[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) is an R package for building web applications in R. These are a few simple Shiny applications that I have built:

&nbsp;| Description | Preview | Repository
------|-------------|---------|-----------
[wine](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/wine) | Choose two variables to create a scatterplot that best separates three cultivars of wine | [![wine](wine.png)](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/wine) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/shiny_wine)
[wine_models](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/wine_models) | Comparison of a few different models to determine the cultivars of wines based on their chemical properties | [![wine_models](wine_models.png)](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/wine_models) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/shiny_wine_models)
[pub_time](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/pub_time) | My friends couldn't decide when to go to the pub. This app picks a random time between two end points, and declares it pub time. | [![pub_time](pub_time.png)](https://shiny.mdneuzerling.com/pub_time) | [GitHub](https://github.com/mdneuzerling/shiny_pub_time)
