<p>If you work in a corporate environment, there’s a good chance you’re using
Microsoft Office. I wanted to set up a way to email tables and plots from R
using Outlook. Sending an email is simple enough with the <a href="http://www.omegahat.net/RDCOMClient/">RDCOMClient</a> library, but
inserting a plot inline—rather than as an attachment—took a little bit of
working out. I’m sharing my code here in case anyone else wants to do something
similar. The trick is to save your plot as an image with a temporary file,
attach it to the email, and then insert it inline using a cid (Content-ID).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(RDCOMClient)
library(ggplot2)

# Create a simple scatterplot with ggplo2
SimplePlot &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=mpg)) + geom_point()
# Create a temporary file path for the image that we will attach to our email
SimplePlot.file &lt;- tempfile(fileext = &quot;.png&quot;)
# Save the ggplot we just created as an image with the temporary file path
ggsave(plot = SimplePlot, file = SimplePlot.file,
        device = &quot;png&quot;, width = 4, height = 4)

# Create an Outlook object, a new email, and set the parameters.
Outlook &lt;- COMCreate(&quot;Outlook.Application&quot;)
Email &lt;- Outlook$CreateItem(0)
Email[[&quot;To&quot;]] &lt;- &quot;johnsmith@example.com&quot;
Email[[&quot;subject&quot;]] &lt;- &quot;A simple scatterplot&quot;
# Some text before we insert our plot
Body &lt;- &quot;&lt;p&gt;Your scatterplot is here:&lt;/p&gt;&quot;

# First add the temporary file as an attachment.
Email[[&quot;Attachments&quot;]]$Add(SimplePlot.file)
# Refer to the attachment with a cid
# &quot;basename&quot; returns the file name without the directory.
SimplePlot.inline &lt;- paste0( &quot;&lt;img src=&#39;cid:&quot;,
        basename(SimplePlot.file),
        &quot;&#39; width = &#39;400&#39; height = &#39;400&#39;&gt;&quot;)
# Put the text and plot together in the body of the email.
Email[[&quot;HTMLBody&quot;]] &lt;- paste0(Body, SimplePlot.inline)

# Either display the email in Outlook or send it straight away.
# Comment out either line.
Email$Display()
#Email$Send()

# Delete the temporary file used to attach images.
unlink(SimplePlot.file)</code></pre>
