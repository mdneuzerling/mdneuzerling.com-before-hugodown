<p>When I found myself using R in a corporate environment, my workflow went
like this:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Connect to databases</li>
<li>Do stuff to data</li>
<li><strong>Email</strong> results</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, there exist options for presenting results that are a bit more modern than
the old-fashioned email—R Markdown, Shiny, or even Slack, for example. But
email is embedded in corporate culture and will be around for a long time to
come.</p>
<p>I want to set down how I think a <code>send_email</code> function should work in R.</p>
<div id="but-we-can-already-send-emails-in-r" class="section level2">
<h2>But we can already send emails in R</h2>
<p>Just sending an email is nothing new. There’s the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/sendmailR/index.html"><code>sendmailR</code></a> and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mailR/index.html"><code>mailR</code></a>
packages, for example. These use the SMTP protocol. Then there’s the <code>gmailr</code>
package, which connects to gmail’s REST API to send (and receive) mail. I’ve
played around with doing the same for Outlook (<code>outlookr</code>, anyone?), which also
covers the Office365 environment found almost ubiquitously in older corporate
environments.</p>
<p>My first attempt to improving my workflow used none of that. I used
<a href="https://github.com/omegahat/RDCOMClient">Duncan Temple Lang ’s <code>RDCOMClient</code></a>
(also available on <a href="https://github.com/omegahat/RDCOMClient">GitHub</a>)
to connect to a locally installed copy of Microsoft Outlook. This
package allows R to connect to the DCOM architecture. You can think of DCOM as
an API for communicating with Microsoft Office in Windows environments.</p>
<p>I’ll talk about the benefits and drawbacks of DCOM later, but the main appeal
for me is that I can connect R to the Outlook application installed on my
(Windows) computer, and let Outlook handle all of that super tricky
authentication nonsense. This was the appeal for me—no passwords or OAuth
keys, because that stuff is all too <em>hard</em>.</p>
<p>For my use case, I wanted to send things like reports and alerts. That meant
sending ggplots and data frames, not as attachments but <em>in the body of the
email</em>. With a lot of help from StackExchange, I worked out how to do this
with <code>RDCOMClient</code>. I wanted to do more than just <em>send an email in R</em>. I
wanted emailing from within R to feel like a natural extension of the
language.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-prototype-rdcomoutlook" class="section level2">
<h2>The prototype: <code>RDCOMOutlook</code></h2>
<p>I’ve been playing around with <code>RDCOMClient</code> <a href="/post/using-r-to-send-an-outlook-email-with-an-inline-image/">for a while</a>. It was
even responsible for my first StackExchange answer. But all of stuff I had
learnt was scattered across a dozen stray R scripts. So I spent a week turning
everything I had done with <code>RDCOMClient</code> into a package called <code>RDCOMOutlook</code>,
available on <a href="https://github.com/mdneuzerling/RDCOMOutlook">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>I want to be clear here: this package is a proof-of-concept, and I have no plans
to develop it any futher. I’m not submitting it to CRAN, especially since
<code>RDCOMClient</code> itself is no longer available on CRAN. But developing the package
helped me realise what I wanted a <code>send_email</code> function to look like.</p>
<p>Actually, in <code>RDCOMOutlook</code> it’s called <code>prepare_email</code>. You can do this
thing with DCOM where you get the email to pop up on the user’s screen without
immediately sending. I thought that was cool, and I made it the default
behaviour, with a <code>send</code> argument as an option.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-prototype-prepare_email" class="section level2">
<h2>The prototype: <code>prepare_email</code></h2>
<p>Here’s the head of the <code>prepare_email</code> function in <code>RDCOMOutlook</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>prepare_email &lt;- function(
    embeddings = NULL,
    body = &quot;&quot;,
    to = &quot;&quot;,
    cc = &quot;&quot;,
    subject = &quot;&quot;,
    attachments = NULL,
    css = &quot;&quot;,
    send = FALSE,
    data_file_format = &quot;csv&quot;,
    image_file_format = &quot;png&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>You can see some expected stuff in there. Emails have bodies, subjects,
recipients and (optionally) cc’d recipients and attachments. These arguments
are natural and expected. These are HTML emails, so you can even use some
custom CSS (I used this to put some company colours into my reports). None of
the arguments are required; running <code>prepare_email()</code> causes a blank Outlook
composition window to pop up on the user’s screen.</p>
<p>But <code>embeddings</code>, <code>data_file_format</code> and <code>image_file_format</code> are a bit weirder.
And <code>embeddings</code> is the <em>first</em> argument. The first argument in an R function is
in a privileged position, because that’s the default target for the pipe
(<code>%&gt;%</code>).</p>
<p>Here’s what happens when you give object <code>obj</code> to the <code>embeddings</code>
argument:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>If <code>obj</code> is a ggplot, it will be embedded into the <strong>body</strong> of the email as
a resonably sized image.</li>
<li>If <code>obj</code> is a data frame or tibble, it will be converted into a HTML table
and embedded into the body of the email.</li>
<li>If <code>obj</code> is a file path pointing to an image file, it will be embedded into
the body of the email.</li>
<li>If <code>obj</code> is a file path pointing to a file that isn’t an image, it will be
passed to the <code>attachments</code> argument.</li>
<li>Failing all of that, an error is thrown: <code>obj is not a ggplot, data frame,  tibble or valid file path. Check that the file exists.</code></li>
</ol>
<p>A benefit of <code>DCOM</code> is that you can get the user’s email signature as defined
in Outlook. So I put the embedding between the provided <code>body</code> and the
signature.</p>
<p>The <code>attachments</code> argument follows similar logic, except it will attach a
plot or data frame/tibble. This is where the file format arguments come into
play. I like <code>data_file_format</code>—you might want to send an Excel file, for
example. But I think we can do without the <code>image_file_format</code> argument. Does
anyone really care if their image is a jpeg or a png?</p>
</div>
<div id="what-happens-in-the-background" class="section level2">
<h2>What happens in the background?</h2>
<p>To embed or attach a ggplot, we need to save it as a file in a temporary
location. We attach the file and—if we’re embedding it—refer to the file
name in an HTML tag using a <em>content identifider (cid)</em>. This tells the
email client that it needs to show the attachment in the body of the email.</p>
<p>When I first tried to do this I got some warped ggplots. You need to specify
image dimensions in HTML, but that means <em>getting</em> the image dimensions. The
<code>readbitmap</code> package is crucial here, since it lets me inspect the most
commonly used image formats.</p>
<p>At one point, I was inspecting file headers to try to guess the image format!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file_header &lt;- readBin(file_path, &quot;raw&quot;, n = 8)

# Reference headers
png_header &lt;- as.raw(strtoi(c(&quot;89&quot;, &quot;50&quot;, &quot;4e&quot;, &quot;47&quot;, &quot;0d&quot;, &quot;0a&quot;, &quot;1a&quot;, &quot;0a&quot;), 16))
jpg_header &lt;- as.raw(strtoi(c(&quot;FF&quot;, &quot;D8&quot;), 16))
bmp_header &lt;- as.raw(strtoi(c(&quot;42&quot;, &quot;4D&quot;), 16))
gif_header &lt;- as.raw(strtoi(c(&quot;47&quot;, &quot;49&quot;, &quot;46&quot;), 16))

format &lt;- if (identical(file_header, png_header)) {
    &quot;png&quot;
} else if (identical(file_header[1:2], jpg_header)) {
    &quot;jpg&quot;
} else if (identical(file_header[1:2], bmp_header)) {
    &quot;bmp&quot;
} else if (identical(file_header[1:3], gif_header)) {
    &quot;gif&quot;
} else {
    &quot;unknown&quot;
}</code></pre>

<p>The images then have to be scaled down to a reasonable maximum size (I used
800 pixels in either dimension), while preserving the image ratio.</p>
<p>There’s also the matter of turning stuff into a list in R. I can run lists
through <code>purrr</code> functions to embed/attach multiple files. But am I the only one
who finds this really hard? Check out this hideous helper function I used:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>make_list &lt;- function(x) {
    if (is.null(x)) {
        x
    } else if (is.ggplot(x)) { # ggplots are lists
        list(x)
    } else if (is.data.frame(x)) {
        list(x)  
    } else if (is.list(x)) {
        x
    } else if (is.vector(x)) {
        as.list(x)
    } else {
        list(x) # single item case
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Lists are also important here because lists can have <em>names</em>, and we need those
for embeddings and attachments. If the user puts only <code>obj</code> into the embeddings
or attachments argument, <code>prepare_email</code> will attach, for example, <code>obj.png</code>.
With a list of embeddings or attachments, it will use the names in the list. If
these aren’t available, or if the object is named <code>.</code> (as would be the case if
it is coming from a pipe), sensible dummy names are used. File names aren’t
visible for embeddings, but we do need to ensure that they don’t conflict, or
else the cid tags will get confused.</p>
</div>
<div id="the-ideal-send_email-function" class="section level2">
<h2>The ideal <code>send_email</code> function</h2>
<p>As I said, I don’t have any plans to develop this package any further.
<code>RDCOMOutlook</code> is great for my situation, but it’s not a modern answer. For one
thing, it only works on Windows, and only with Outlook. DCOM itself is old and
the documentation is non-existent; there were times here where I was literally
<em>guessing</em> function names.</p>
<p>But most of the hard stuff is just juggling list names and image dimensions.
That doesn’t use DCOM. So why can’t I take what I’ve done and stick in some
other way of sending emails? So maybe the new function, <code>send_email</code>, will
have something like a <code>connection</code> argument?</p>
<p>Without DCOM I do lose that nifty ability to make an email pop up on the
screen instead of sending it. That’s why I have to drop the <code>prepare_email</code>
function name. I might also lose the ability to pick up the user’s signature.</p>
<p>Here’s a possible way to move away from DCOM:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Focus on getting the prototype to work with SMTP. I imagine this covers the
majority of use cases.</li>
<li>Bring in compatibility with <code>gmailr</code>.</li>
<li>Using <code>gmailr</code> as a guide, create <code>outlookr</code> and bring it into the fold.</li>
</ol>
<p>I’ve actually had a fair bit of luck accessing the Outlook API using the
wonderful <code>httr</code> package. I can authenticate and download email attachments.
But Turning all of that into a proper package with good credential handling
would be a challenge.</p>
</div>
<div id="bonus-goal-searching-emails" class="section level2">
<h2>Bonus goal: searching emails</h2>
<p>I built something else for the <code>RDCOMOutlook</code> prototype: the ability to search
for emails and download attachments. The results are displayed in a nice,
pretty tibble:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>RDCOMOutlook::search_emails(&quot;test&quot;) %&gt;% select(subject, received, attachments)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 3 x 3
##   subject                         received            attachments 
##   &lt;chr&gt;                           &lt;dttm&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;       
## 1 This is a test email            2018-06-12 16:42:42 &quot;&quot;          
## 2 Another test                    2018-06-12 17:36:08 &quot;&quot;          
## 3 A test email with an attachment 2018-06-12 17:36:36 shiborgi.jpg</code></pre>
<p>The problem here is that the <code>AdvancedSearch</code> method of DCOM is
<em>asynchronous</em>; that is, the search will continue to run in the background
while R continues with the next statement. There is an <code>AdvancedSearchComplete</code>
<em>event</em>, I wasn’t able to work out how to handle DCOM events. There is a
package, called <code>RDCOMEvents</code>, that sounds suitable for this.</p>
<p>But I was able to download attachments from an Office365 email account using
the Outlook REST API. I believe that <code>gmailr</code> can do the same. So I can
probably recreate this without DCOM. This is a stretch goal, and probably a
distraction, but it does seem like nice functionality to have.</p>
