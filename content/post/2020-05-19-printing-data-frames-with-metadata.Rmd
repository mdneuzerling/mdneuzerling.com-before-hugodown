I'm creating an R API wrapper around my state's public transport service. To make life easier for the users, the responses from the API calls are parsed and returned as tibbles/data frames. To make life easier for me, I need to keep track of the API call behind each tibble. I do this by using the `tibble::new_tibble()` function to attach metadata to the tibble as attributes, and creating a custom `print` method to make the metadata visible.

First, the raw response from the API call is structured as a list:

```{r response, eval = FALSE}
response <- list(
    request = request_url_without_auth,
    retrieved = format(
      Sys.time(),
      format = "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS %Z",
      tz = "Australia/Melbourne"
    ),
    status_code = status_code,
    content = content
)
```

Some other function will take the content in this list, process it, and create a `parsed` tibble. We hand this off to the `tibble::new_tibble()` function. Along with the new class name --- "ptvapi" --- we also attach the `response` metadata as attributes to the new tibble.

```{r parsed, eval = FALSE}
tibble::new_tibble(
    parsed,
    nrow = nrow(parsed),
    class = "ptvapi",
    request = response$request,
    retrieved = response$retrieved,
    status_code = response$status_code,
    content = response$content
  )
```

Let's say we have a tibble `flinders_departures` created through this process. `flinders_departures` will have the following classes, in order: "ptvapi", "tbl_df", "tbl", and "data.frame".

For those who are unfamiliar to S3, some functions in R --- like `print()`, `summary()` and `predict()` --- are _generics_. When generics are called, R will look through the classes of the argument to find the right _method_ to call. When we call `print(flinders_departures)` (or, equivalently, enter `flinders_departures` at the console) R will first look for the `print.ptvapi()` method. If it can't find that, it will move on to `print.tbl_df()`, and so on, until it tries `print.default()`.

If I were to let R go through this method I would print `flinders_departure` without printing the metadata. So I created a simple way of printing out those attributes:

```{r print, eval = FALSE}
print.ptvapi <- function(x) {
  if (!is.null(attr(x, "request"))) {
    cat("Request:", attr(x, "request"), "\n")
  }
  if (!is.null(attr(x, "retrieved"))) {
    cat("Retrieved:", attr(x, "retrieved"), "\n")
  }
  if (!is.null(attr(x, "status_code"))) {
    cat("Status code:", attr(x, "status_code"), "\n")
  }
  NextMethod()
}
```

This method will print out the attributes if they exist. `NextMethod()` will then make R go down the class chain, until it prints like a regular tibble. This is great for debugging. The response of the API call is (more or less) determined by the three attributes I specially print. So it makes life much easier for me to be able relate the parsed tibble to the API response.
