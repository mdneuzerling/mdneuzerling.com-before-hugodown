      <description>Whenever I take an interest in something I think to myself, “How can I combine this with R?”
This post is the result of applying that attitude to Dungeons and Dragons.
So how would I combine D&amp;amp;D with R? A good start would be to have a nice data set of Dungeons and Dragons monsters, with all of their statistics, abilities and attributes. One of the core D&amp;amp;D rule books is the Monster Manual.</description>

      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I can’t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>
