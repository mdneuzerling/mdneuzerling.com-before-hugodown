      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I canâ€™t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>
