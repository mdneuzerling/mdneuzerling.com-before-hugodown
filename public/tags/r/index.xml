      <description>Ozone data set Patterns of missing data Visualising missing data Dealing with missing values A refresher on PCA PCA imputation I missed a lot   These are my notes the third and final tutorial of useR2018, and the tutorial I was looking forward to the most. I struggle with missing value imputation. It’s one of those things which I kind of get the theory of, but fall over when trying to do.</description>

      <description>Reasons for modifying the data The ames data A simple log-transform Infrequently occurring levels The recipes process Other uses   These are my notes for the tutorial given by Max Kuhn on the afternoon of the first day of the UseR 2018 conference.
Full confession here: I was having trouble deciding between this tutorial and another one, and eventually decided on the other one. But then I accidentally came to the wrong room and I took it as a sign that it was time to learn more about preprocessing.</description>

      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I can’t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>

      <description>If you work in a corporate environment, there’s a good chance you’re using Microsoft Office. I wanted to set up a way to email tables and plots from R using Outlook. Sending an email is simple enough with the RDCOMClient library, but inserting a plot inline—rather than as an attachment—took a little bit of working out. I’m sharing my code here in case anyone else wants to do something similar. The trick is to save your plot as an image with a temporary file, attach it to the email, and then insert it inline using a cid (Content-ID).</description>
