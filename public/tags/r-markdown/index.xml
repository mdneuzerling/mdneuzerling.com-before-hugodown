      <description>That’s it for #useR2018. After 6 keynotes, 132 parallel sessions, many more lightning talks and posters, and an all-important conference dinner, we’ve reached the end of the week.
This was my first proper conference since 2015. I had almost forgotten how it felt to be surrounded by hundreds of people who are just as passionate (if not more) about your tiny area of specialised knowledge than you are.
I took notes for the three tutorials I went to, but I wanted to take a moment to review the week as a whole, including the talks that stood out to me.</description>

      <description>Ozone data set Patterns of missing data Visualising missing data Dealing with missing values A refresher on PCA PCA imputation I missed a lot   These are my notes for the third and final tutorial of useR2018, and the tutorial I was looking forward to the most. I struggle with missing value imputation. It’s one of those things which I kind of get the theory of, but fall over when trying to do.</description>

      <description>Docker glossary Running docker images Rocker R hello world Playing with the hello-world image A note on security Managing Docker without leaving R  Docker on AWS And that’s it!   These are my notes for the super helpful tutorial given by Elizabeth Stark on the first day of the UseR 2018 conference.

      <description>Reasons for modifying the data The ames data A simple log-transform Infrequently occurring levels The recipes process Other uses   These are my notes for the tutorial given by Max Kuhn on the afternoon of the first day of the UseR 2018 conference.
Full confession here: I was having trouble deciding between this tutorial and another one, and eventually decided on the other one. But then I accidentally came to the wrong room and I took it as a sign that it was time to learn more about preprocessing.</description>

      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I can’t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>
