      <description>When I found myself using R in a corporate environment, my workflow went like this:
Connect to databases Do stuff to data Email results  Yes, there exist options for presenting results that are a bit more modern than the old-fashioned email—R Markdown, Shiny, or even Slack, for example. But email is embedded in corporate culture and will be around for a long time to come.
I want to set down how I think a send_email function should work in R.</description>

      <description>Ozone data set Patterns of missing data Visualising missing data Dealing with missing values A refresher on PCA PCA imputation I missed a lot   These are my notes for the third and final tutorial of useR2018, and the tutorial I was looking forward to the most. I struggle with missing value imputation. It’s one of those things which I kind of get the theory of, but fall over when trying to do.</description>

      <description>Reasons for modifying the data The ames data A simple log-transform Infrequently occurring levels The recipes process Other uses   These are my notes for the tutorial given by Max Kuhn on the afternoon of the first day of the UseR 2018 conference.

      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I can’t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>
