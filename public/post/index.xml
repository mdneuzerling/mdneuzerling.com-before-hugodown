      <description>If you listen to university advertisements for data science masters degrees, you’d believe that data scientists are so in-demand that they can walk into any company, state their salary, and start work straight away.
Not quite.
Interviewing for data science positions is tough, and job-seekers face some bad behaviour from recruiters and hiring managers. Many companies understand that they need to do something with data, but they don’t know what. They’ll say they want machine learning when they really want a few dashboards.</description>

      <description>Whenever I take an interest in something I think to myself, “How can I combine this with R?”
This post is the result of applying that attitude to Dungeons and Dragons.
So how would I combine D&amp;amp;D with R? A good start would be to have a nice data set of Dungeons and Dragons monsters, with all of their statistics, abilities and attributes. One of the core D&amp;amp;D rule books is the Monster Manual.</description>

      <description>When I found myself using R in a corporate environment, my workflow went like this:
Connect to databases Do stuff to data Email results  Yes, there exist options for presenting results that are a bit more modern than the old-fashioned email—R Markdown, Shiny, or even Slack, for example. But email is embedded in corporate culture and will be around for a long time to come.
I want to set down how I think a send_email function should work in R.</description>

      <description>That’s it for #useR2018. After 6 keynotes, 132 parallel sessions, many more lightning talks and posters, and an all-important conference dinner, we’ve reached the end of the week.
This was my first proper conference since 2015. I had almost forgotten how it felt to be surrounded by hundreds of people who are just as passionate (if not more) about your tiny area of specialised knowledge than you are.
I took notes for the three tutorials I went to, but I wanted to take a moment to review the week as a whole, including the talks that stood out to me.</description>

      <description>Ozone data set Patterns of missing data Visualising missing data Dealing with missing values A refresher on PCA PCA imputation I missed a lot   These are my notes for the third and final tutorial of useR2018, and the tutorial I was looking forward to the most. I struggle with missing value imputation. It’s one of those things which I kind of get the theory of, but fall over when trying to do.</description>

These are my notes for the super helpful tutorial given by Elizabeth Stark on the first day of the UseR 2018 conference. This was an introduction to Docker for R users who have no prior experience with Docker (which was me!</description>

      <description>Reasons for modifying the data The ames data A simple log-transform Infrequently occurring levels The recipes process Other uses   These are my notes for the tutorial given by Max Kuhn on the afternoon of the first day of the UseR 2018 conference.
Full confession here: I was having trouble deciding between this tutorial and another one, and eventually decided on the other one. But then I accidentally came to the wrong room and I took it as a sign that it was time to learn more about preprocessing.</description>

      <description>My knowledge of wine covers three facts:
I like red wine. I do not like white wine. I love wine data.  I came across a great collection of around 130,000 wine reviews, each a paragraph long, on Kaggle. This is juicy stuff, and I can’t wait to dig into it with some text analysis, or maybe build some sort of markov chain or neural network that generates new wine reviews.</description>

      <title>Using R to send an Outlook email with an inline image</title>

      <description>If you work in a corporate environment, there’s a good chance you’re using Microsoft Office. I wanted to set up a way to email tables and plots from R using Outlook. Sending an email is simple enough with the RDCOMClient library, but inserting a plot inline—rather than as an attachment—took a little bit of working out. I’m sharing my code here in case anyone else wants to do something similar. The trick is to save your plot as an image with a temporary file, attach it to the email, and then insert it inline using a cid (Content-ID).</description>

      <description>Last year an honours student noticed something missing in mathematics and statistics at La Trobe University. She saw that there was no society at the university to cultivate an interest in mathematics. There were no social events to help the undergraduate students get to know one another. And there was very little in the way of extracurricular lectures for students without several years of mathematical study already under their belt. So she started the Mathematics and Statistics Society at La Trobe University.</description>

      <title>My fourth Australasian Combinatorics Conference</title>

      <description>My first maths conference was The 36th Australasian Conference on Combinatorial Mathematics and Combinatorial Computing. I had just finished my honours thesis, Generalising the Clique-Coclique Bound, and I had travelled to Sydney to present my results to a room full of people much smarter than me.
I’m no longer working in graph theory or finite geometry, but every year since 2012 I have attended the ACCMCC. I keep up to date with the research, and I maintain contact with some of the best mathematicians I’ve ever met.</description>
